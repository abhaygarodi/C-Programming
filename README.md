# CDAC-C-Programs
This repository contains all C programs I practiced and developed while studying at CDAC.
The goal is to strengthen my understanding of C programming fundamentals — including control structures, arrays, strings, pointers, structures, unions, dynamic memory allocation, and file handling.
File represents daily learning and hands-on coding tasks from CDAC sessions.
